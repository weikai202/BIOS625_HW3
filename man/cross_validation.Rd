\title{Perform k-fold Cross-Validation for Linear Regression}
\usage{
cross_validation(x, y, k = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the predictor variable(s) (independent variable).}

\item{y}{A numeric vector representing the response variable (dependent variable).}

\item{k}{An integer specifying the number of folds for cross-validation. The default is 5.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the mean MSE (Mean Squared Error) from the k-fold cross-validation.
}
\description{
This function performs k-fold cross-validation on a linear regression model. It splits the data into k subsets (folds), trains the model on the training set, and evaluates the model's performance on the test set using Mean Squared Error (MSE). The final result is the average MSE across all folds.
}
\details{
The function splits the data into \code{k} folds and performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item For each fold, it trains a linear regression model on the training set (the other k-1 folds) and tests the model on the test set (the current fold).
\item The MSE for each fold is calculated and stored.
\item Finally, the function returns the average MSE across all folds.
}
}
\examples{
# Example usage with simulated data
x <- rnorm(100)  # Generate random predictor data
y <- 2 * x + 3 + rnorm(100, sd = 0.5)  # Generate response variable with noise
mean_mse <- cross_validation(x, y, k = 5)
print(mean_mse)
